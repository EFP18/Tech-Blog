### Description

Tech Blog is a platform where people can make posts about technical concepts and new technologies, and share them with other developers. The website allows for profile owners to edit their previous posts, or delete them, but it also allows developers to comment on other people's posts.

### Installation

A user needs to sign up and code away. That's how simple our website is!

To create this project, the repository follows the Model-View-Controller paradigm, as well as the `express-handlebars` package. For the creation of the database, we used `Sequelize` and `MySQL2`.

### Usage

To give developers a place where they can share their ideas and discuss them with fellow coders and other developers.

### License
